Progress
 26.07
   - Create an empty app with /NODEFAULTLIB for clang
   - Read\show file
   - hjkl movements
   - Insert mode
   - o O

 27.07
   - x X C D
   - I aA <C-o>
   - dl d5l
   - dib cab


 28.07
  Plan
    - Generalize operations, such that you will have less if branches
    - Scroll
    - Undo\redo
    - Visual\VisualLine modes
  Actually skipped the day completely

 29.07
   - Generalize operations. Now motions and actions are separate
   - Scroll
   - Search
   - backspace to remove char during insert mode
   - <C-w> to remove word during insert
   - Enter in insert mode
   - cw removes new line for the last word (probably shouldn't)

 30.07
   - Switch between buffers via <A-1> and <A-2>. No split for now 
   - Visual and VisualLine modes
   - yank and paste

 31.07
   y Visual and VisualLine mode is broken
   y Proper buffer management when pasting. Check if new lines are paste after\before line if buffer has \n

 1.08
   y Undo\redo
   y Rebuild and reload dll with calling a render function

 2.08
   Skipped

 3.08
   - Formatting the code preserving the cursor position
   
 4.08
   p W B
   p start working on collapsing items
   
 Key features missing
   y formatting
   - seach in members (use ctags)
   - pass events into the rendered area
   - preserve state between rebuilds (check state version)

 Backlog
   - Collapse\open nested items
   - tab \ shift tab
   - move line/selection up/down
   - show compilation errors
   - integrate clang-format
   - History of buffers
   - Autorun build.bat
   - Integrate with ctags
   - Syntax highlight
   - multiple cursor
   - cursor history
   - integrate something like unit\e2e tests into the editor
   - research on how hard it is to create debugger
