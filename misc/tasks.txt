  Notes: 
   - P and p not inserting after cursor is several lines are copied
   - local search is applied to another buffer
   - local search is not recalculated when editing a document
   - if I'm runnind I should show results, like errors or something
   - removing chars from local search can go negative, like -2
   - need to show if focus on local search term or not
   - each time I type I advance in search
   - can't switch buffer in local search mode
   - if file haven't changed - don't write it. Messes up git history
