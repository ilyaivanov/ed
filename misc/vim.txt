Practical Vim notes
The Vim Way
  1. Repeat last action via . "Meet the Dot Command"
  2. Don't repeat yourself. Appending ; in a js example.
  3. Take one step back, then three forward. Example of js formatting arg1+","+arg2
    Repeat f{char} search forward via ; and backward ,
  4. Act, Repeat, Reverse
  5. Find and replace by hand
  6. Meet the dot formula - one keystroke to move, one to execute
  7. Pause with your brush off the page
  8. Chunk your undos
  9. Compose your edits
  10. Use Counts to Do Simple Arithmetic
  11. Donâ€™t Count If You Can Repeat
  12. Combine and Conquer
    Operator + Motions = Action
  13. make corrections instantly from insert mode
    C-h delete back one char
    C-w -deleta back one word
    C-u delete to start of the line
  14. Switch to normal mode. C-o for Insert Normal mode (one action).
  15. paste from the register without leaving insert mode
    <C-r>0 - paste from the register in the insert mode
  16. Do back-of-the-envelope calculations in place
    <C-r>= to insert calculation in INSERT mode
  17. Insert Unusual Characters by Character Code
  18. Insert Unusual Characters by Digraph
  19. Overwrite Existing 2resdfu Replace Mode
  20. Grok visual mode
  21. Define a Visual Selection
     v V <C-v> - char, line, block visual modes
     gv - select last visual selection
     o - go to the other end of the visual selection
  22. Repeat Line-Wise Visual Commands
  23. Prefer Operators to Visual Commands Where Possible
  24. Edit Tabular Data with Visual-Block Mode
  25. Change columns of text 
  26. Append After a Ragged Visual Block
  ...
  48. Place hands on the home row
  49. Move word-wise
    b    b  p    w
    prev current next
      ge       e    e

    word - sequence of letters, digits, and underscores, or as a sequence of other nonblank characters separated with whitespace
    WORD - sequence of nonblank characters separated with whitespace

    W    W     W     W   W
    e.g. we're going too slow
    wwww w ww  w     w   w
