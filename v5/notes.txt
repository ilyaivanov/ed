Starting to work on a v5 (this time I will get it done, right?)
Repeat same functionality (without undo/redo) but with nested items (collapse, show) 
and minimal-readonly files system support

What do I need to do this? 
  - scroll/autoscroll
  - gg G
  - wW bB iI aA oO 
  - c-hjkl
  - save files 
  - multichar motions
  - enter in insert mode
  - fF tT
  - composite motions, but hardcoded and limited
  - move items around
  - popup menu like in Helix for z g space
  - cursor history
  - multiple cursors
