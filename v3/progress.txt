     - TextOut into global bitmap
     - Paint into it
     - No need to call InvalidateRect
     - Animation should work
     - Test performance
         - 12.0ms for textout (9.3 without bitblit)
         - 5.0ms for printstr (2.3 without bitblit)

Command = Operation? + Motion (Operation is optional)
 - Commands which modify text can be repeated
 - Single motions can be repeated separately

Example of motions
  - Vjd - enter visual line mode, remove two lines, store this for later in .
  - c2lfoo<Esc> - remove two lines, enter insert mode, enter foo, exit 

Motion + Operation = Command
 - Undo
 - Repeat last motion
 - Repeat last command

   - add ability to change if ft motions are multiline (hardcode config in the code). This will also affect h l x
   x repeat last search ; in same direction and , in opposite direction (postpone)
 y G gg 0 $ ^ (% postponed) 
 - Add commands like dw or ct)
 - Add ranges line dib ciB
 - Add numerical ranges like d2w
 - Add line ranges like dl and d2l (vim equivalent of dd and d2d)
