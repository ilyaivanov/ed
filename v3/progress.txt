Plan for Motions implementation
 - hjkl
 - wWeEbBgegE
 - fx Fx tX Tx  
   - add ability to change if ft motions are multiline (hardcode config in the code)
   - repeat last search ; in same direction and , in opposite direction
 - G gg 0 $ % ^ 
 - Add commands like dw or ct)
 - Add ranges line dib ciB
